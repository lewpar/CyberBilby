## Who am I?

I am a student from Victoria, Australia with a keen interest in CyberSec, Programming, Networking & Video Game Modding. I like to learn new things every day and enjoy teaching others what I have learnt.

## What is the purpose?

As I learn new things I like to document my journey in the form of technical articles, blogs or tutorials for others to explore and learn.

I like to keep things short and to the point so the content of my articles or tutorials will likely be succinct in nature.

Other can also contribute to the blog by making changes or creating their own posts by creating a pull request (PR) at https://github.com/lewpar/cyberbilby. 

Cyber Bilby will always run without JavaScript, so if you see any executing please make an issue on the github repository.
